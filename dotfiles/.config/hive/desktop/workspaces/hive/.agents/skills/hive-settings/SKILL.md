Configure Hive Desktop's application settings.

Hive Desktop is a desktop app that turns GitHub activity and webhook deliveries
into triaged feeds and automated coding-agent sessions. Its configuration is
plain text on this machine, meant to be edited directly:

- /home/mduren/.config/hive/desktop/flows/<id>.yaml — flows: the graph that decides what reaches which feed and what fires an action.
- /home/mduren/.config/hive/desktop/actions.yml — actions: what a feed item, a terminal session or window, or a flow node can trigger.
- /home/mduren/.config/hive/desktop/settings.yaml — app settings: polling, updates, notifications, appearance, keyboard shortcuts.

Edit /home/mduren/.config/hive/desktop/settings.yaml. Every key is optional; omitted values use safe
compiled defaults. The app reloads user-facing settings on save. The HTTP
listener and the development listeners are startup configuration: they are
read once and take effect on the next launch.

## Schema

```yaml
polling:
  interval: 5m            # Go duration; minimum 60s. Default 5m.

updates:
  enabled: true           # check for and offer app updates
  channel: stable         # stable, beta, or dev; omit to follow the build

notifications:
  enabled: true
  delivery: auto          # auto, system, or app
  sound: true

appearance:
  theme: dark             # frontend theme id
  terminal_font_size: ""  # small, medium, large, xl, or xxl; empty means medium
  terminal_font_family: "" # any installed monospace family; empty is the bundled JetBrains Mono
  terminal_font_weight: 0 # 300, 350, 400, 600, or 700; 0 means the default, 350
  terminal_font_weight_bold: 0 # weight bold cells draw at; 0 means the default, 700
  terminal_line_height: 0 # 1 to 1.6 in tenths; 0 means the default, 1.2
  terminal_letter_spacing: 0 # extra tracking in device pixels, 0 to 3
  terminal_show_windows: true # list every active session's windows in the terminal sidebar
  terminal_show_status_bar: true # git and pull-request state above the attached session
  terminal_pool_size: 3   # sessions kept attached for instant switching (1-6)

profiles:                 # the profile rail
  order:                  # flow ids, top of the rail first. Ids left out sort
    - personal            # alphabetically after every id named here, and an id
    - hive                # naming no flow is ignored.

http:                     # the local loopback server; webhook ingress and the
                          # terminal transport both ride it
  enabled: true           # on by default; read at startup
  host: 127.0.0.1         # loopback only
  port: 0                 # 0 asks the OS to choose

keybindings:               # sparse overrides keyed by command id
  feed.next: [j, arrowdown]

paths:
  tmux: ""                 # absolute path to a tmux binary; empty discovers one

editor:
  command: ""              # single-word CLI launcher "Open in editor" actions run
                           # on a directory (zed, code, cursor, subl, or a path);
                           # "" means none configured

agent_workspaces:
  dir: ""                  # workspace root; empty is the config dir's workspaces/.
                           # A leading ~ is expanded at read time.
  session_end_delay: 10s   # grace between a chat asking to end its own session
                           # (a scheduled chat does when its task is done) and
                           # the session being ended

telemetry:
  enabled: false           # export the app's own metrics, logs and traces over OTLP
  endpoint: ""             # signal-less OTLP base, https only; no collector needed
  instance_id: ""          # the endpoint's basic-auth username
  host_id: ""              # optional OpenTelemetry host.id for this machine
  token: ""                # a REFERENCE, never a token. A literal is rejected.
                           # These three accept env:NAME, file:/path, or
                           # op://vault/item/field; only token requires one.
  profiles:
    enabled: false         # push CPU and heap profiles directly with Pyroscope
    endpoint: ""           # Grafana Cloud Profiles base URL, https only
    user: ""               # the Profiles basic-auth username
    token: ""              # a REFERENCE, with the same forms and rules above

development:
  mocks:
    mode: live             # live, feed, pipeline, onboarding, action-smoke
  github:
    api_base: ""           # point GitHub sources at a local proxy
  vite: {host: 127.0.0.1, port: 0}
  wails: {host: 127.0.0.1, port: 0}
  pprof:
    enabled: false         # serves /debug/pprof on the local server
  perf:
    enabled: false         # record UI performance spans to a JSONL file
  metrics:
    enabled: false         # serves /metrics on the local server for a scrape
  debug:
    pause_ingest: 0s
    pause_commit: 0s
```

## Rules

- Unknown keys, multiple YAML documents, invalid closed-set values, unsafe listener hosts, and invalid ports are rejected.
- `version` is written and migrated by the app. Do not add or edit it.
- `polling.interval` below 60s is rejected.
- Durations are strings like `5m`; a bare number is not seconds.
- `http` is on by default. `development.pprof` defaults off. Configured listener hosts must be loopback.
- `telemetry.enabled` requires `telemetry.endpoint`, `telemetry.instance_id` and `telemetry.token`, and the endpoint must be https. It is the one URL setting that is deliberately not loopback-only.
- `telemetry.host_id` is optional. When set, it becomes the OpenTelemetry `host.id` resource attribute and the `host_id` profile label. Use a stable unique id for the machine, not the OTLP `instance_id` username. Hive generates a new OpenTelemetry `service.instance.id` for each launch.
- `telemetry.token` must be a reference (`env:`, `file:`, `op://`), never a pasted credential; a literal is a validation error. `telemetry.endpoint` and `telemetry.instance_id` accept either a reference or a written-out value, so one secret can hold a whole destination. Prefer `file:` or `op://` for an installed app, since a launched .app inherits almost no environment.
- `profiles.order` never has to be exhaustive: name only the profiles whose position matters. Dragging a tile in the rail rewrites the whole key; editing it here takes effect on the next launch.
- `keybindings` has its own command-id vocabulary. Read the ids off Settings ▸ Keyboard rather than guessing them. A binding can be a single combo (`j`) or a space-separated sequence of combos pressed in order (`g i`).
